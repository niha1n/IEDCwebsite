          Local Entrepreneurship Advancement Program is an opportunity for the
          IEDCs to dive into the locality to identify and nurture the
          entrepreneurship ecosystem in and around their institution. Being the
          innovation hub of the region, IEDCs can play a pivotal role in
          empowering the local community by creating a conducive ecosystem to
          nurture entrepreneurs in the local community. LEAP is envisaged to
          provide a broader canvas to individual IEDCs to design their
          respective programs and projects.
          <br /><br />
           IEDCs can engage with community organisations, Local Self
          Governments, research institutes, local entrepreneurs, budding
          entrepreneurs, alumni industries/startups for the design and
          implementation of the program. This will also be an opportunity to try
          a hand at social entrepreneurship through which students and budding
          entrepreneurs can give back to society and the sky's the limit for
          this program. In a country like India where opportunities are in every
          nook and corner, IEDCs may go ahead and explore the unseen and unfound
          to bring out the best.

        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The primary objective of the program is to identify and nurture
          entrepreneurs by providing them the necessary support. The program is
          envisaged to transform an IEDC into a local innovation hub which would
          provide services, infrastructure and other capital requirements to the
          budding and aspiring entrepreneurs, local businesses, industries,
          startups, research institutes, and the Local Self Government. Thus,
          IEDCs will become the backbone of the local economy by boosting
          employability, employment opportunities, boosting the status of
          employees, building a problem repository and the corresponding
          solutions.
          <br /><br />
           The program aims to address the pain points of the key stakeholders
          of the local ecosystem through a focused entrepreneurship endeavour.
          LEAP provides an opportunity to aspiring entrepreneurs to identify a
          potential business opportunity by exposing them to real-world customer
          problems.
          <br /><br />
           The program also aims to help local MSMEs/LSGs, government
          institutions and communities to find sustainable and cost effective
          solutions for their critical problems. The program would help MSMEs to
          join the journey of Industrial Revolution 4.0 sooner. IEDC may need to
          develop a plan for LEAP Project and share with Kerala Startup Mission
          to get support to bridge the gap.
